### Background

Delta Shelter is a cabin designed by Tom Kundig of Olson Kundig for Seattle dentist Dr. Michal Friedrich. Construction started in 1998 and was completed in 2002. 

#### Location

The Delta Shelter is located in the rural wilderness of eastern Washington near the flood banks of the Methow river. To the west lie the North Cascades and the North Cascade National Park, making this an exceptionally scenic area to vacation.

The first image is a satellite image showing the general site location of the Delta Shelter (pinpointed by the blue arrow). The yellow arrow points to the Rolling Huts, which is a hotel designed by the same architect. The site plan image demonstrates the environmental challenge that came with building a cabin so close to a seasonally flooding river. [[2](https://trejojess.github.io/delta-shelter/bib#2)]

##### Side View - Open Shutters 
![alt text](https://olsonkundig.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/01_03036_00_N92-2160x1440.jpg "Delta Shelter")
The large windows open up on all four sides of the building, giving a 360 degree field of view of the scenic east Washington landscape. When the windows open, light escapes on all sides, like a lighthouse or watchtower in the wilderness. 

##### Side View - Closed Shutters 
![alt text](https://olsonkundig.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/06_03036_00_N9-1440x1362.jpg "Delta Shelter 2")
The untreated steel encasing the Delta Shelter on all four sides gives way to its unique raw coloring meant to age naturally and change over time. 

### Interior 
The interior of the cabin was decorated by Debbie Kennedy, who works with Kundig at Olson Kundig.

In this last image we can see the exposed mechanical design of the shutters. The large metal "gizmo" or wheel that controls the shutters is characteristic of Kundig's affinity toward industrial imagery.

### Bio
Tom Kundig is a distinguished American architect and owner of the Seattle-based firm, Olson Kundig Architects. He has won many awards, including  many American Institute of Architects awards, as well as the prestigious National Design Award in Architecture Design (2008) from the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum.

### Print Sources

##### Tome Kundig: Houses
The book features magnificent images of the Delta Shelter within it’s scenic backdrops of wilderness. It highlights key features of the design as direct responses to the nature surrounding it such as the stilts the building sits on as well as its large open windows controlled by a wheel operated shutter system. It closes with a refrain by Rick Joy articulating Kundig's motifs and style.[[2](https://trejojess.github.io/delta-shelter/bib#2)]

##### Architectural Record: American Institute of Architects Award
The architectural record features an award given to the Delta Shelter by The AIA Housing Committee. The award contains a summary that highlights the impressions from the judges, appreciating its gorgeous design and harmony with nature. The judges also valued the unique mechanical design of the shutters, praising its ability to completely open the space to the wilderness outside and protecting it when needed.

<!-- <h1 class="center" >Personal Perspective</h1> -->
## Personal Perspective
To research more details about the Delta Shelter, I reviewed interviews, blogs and videos about the building and its architect. 

##### Interview with SeattleMet
> “When you’re inside, you want to feel that the building would just be the frame or the background to your experience of the landscape.” - Tom Kundig

A Seattle reporter interviewed Kundig on his inspiration for Delta Shelter, among other topics. Kundig elaborates on the history of the project, and the effect the location has on architecture. He explains “it’s the local culture, the local weather; it’s the local structural material, systems, the local craft base—all of these things…” that influence architecture. Kundig later discusses his use of contraptions and ‘gizmos’ in his designs and the origin of his affinity toward mechanical imagery. [[2](https://trejojess.github.io/delta-shelter/bib#2)]

##### Interview with ArchRecord
In this interview by the Architectural Record, I learned a few important things from Tom Kundig and his perspective. First is the impact that light has on architecture. Kundig believes that “architecture is about the manipulation of light” and that the usage of natural and artificial light has a significant impact on the function of a building. Secondly, I learned more about what influences Kundig when designing residences. He shares that “residential work really is one of those sort of fundamental, primeval needs that we have as an animal.” He believes that this essential human need for shelter determines the foundations for the expected function of a home, and these expectations also influence the design of more public buildings. Lastly, Kundig ends the interview by commenting on how the background landscape, whether urban or rural, influences a building. He comments that an architect needs to have a holistic understanding of a landscape in order to effectively design a building. By understanding the natural and cultural forces at play, an architect can design a meaningful building that meshes into the landscape.[[6](https://trejojess.github.io/delta-shelter/bib#6)]

##### Buildipedia Blog Article
Reading a blog description of the Delta Shelter, I learned how the careful design of the building took into consideration the walking patterns of multiple people in such a tiny space. With a footprint of 200 square feet, the building was designed with a circulation pattern that allowed for easy access to the entire cabin without congesting the sleeping level. The blogger ends by stating “the Delta Shelter is made to harmonize with the simplicity of its surroundings.” I would have to agree with her statement, as the color palette and rugged material usage fits well with the rural Washington scenery. However, I would qualify that the sharp, ordered, geometric design of the house contrasts heavily with the chaotic and organic forest landscape. This balance between camouflage and juxtaposition is what stands out most for me. [[8](https://trejojess.github.io/delta-shelter/bib#8)]


##### Delta Shelter Walkthrough Video
[![Delta Shelter Youtube Tour](http://img.youtube.com/vi/nQ39NL4z8-0/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/nQ39NL4z8-0?t=556)
While watching this video featuring the inside of the Delta Shelter, I was able to observe the exposed mechanism used to open and close the shutters of the cabin as well as gain an understanding of the force needed to operate it.

##### Photo Cache Impressions

![photo-delta-shelter-1](https://live.staticflickr.com/4104/5436963422_95261cccbc_b.jpg "winter")
While viewing the candid photos of the Delta Shelter taken by others, I was able to grasp a relative scale of the building emphasizing its towering vertical height. Also, seeing the building in different seasons, I was able to see the rust that coats the outer walls change in tone and pattern, resembling a natural wood pattern. Lastly, I noticed the transparency of the building when the shutters are fully opened allow for full illumination via natural light. From the outside, you can see freely into the building, which further removes the separation between the inhabitant and the landscape.

### Sketch

![Delta Shelter Personal Sketch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trejojess/delta-shelter/master/sketch.png "sketch")

In my building sketch, I tried to capture the clean and simple parallel and perpendicular lines that form its structure. These characteristics were the first to catch my eye and were especially prominent in contrast to the natural setting surrounding it.

### Critical Analysis
#### Purpose
The purpose of the Delta Shelter is to be a weekend getaway cabin suited for the diverse climate and weather of rural eastern Washington. The building is situated near the banks of the Methow River, built on stilts to withstand seasonal flooding. 
 

#### Program
The cabin is designed with a utility/storage room on the ground level. Stilts supporting the upper level create an adjacent carport. Outside stairs lead to the entrance of the cabin on the sleeping level. The sleeping level features a master bedroom with a connected balcony and spare bedroom. The sleeping floor houses one and a half bathrooms. The indoor stairs, placed near the entrance, lead to the living level. The living level is an open living space featuring a kitchen, dining area and living area with a fireplace and balcony. 

#### Users
The primary users of the cabin include the owners and their friends and family considering that it's a private domestic property. Secondary users of the cabin might include special visitors there to document the building or spectators there to appreciate its architecture.
